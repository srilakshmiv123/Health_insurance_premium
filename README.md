# Health_insurance_premium
This is about to prediction of health insurance premium.
Based on different factors such as age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of children, smoking status, and region, to determine the risk profile of an individual. Based on this risk assessment, we can  calculate the appropriate premium or cost of health insurance coverage.
In this case, it would be the predicted or actual insurance premium for an individual or group based on their specific characteristics and risk factors. This information helps insurance companies determine the amount of money the insured person or group needs to pay to obtain health insurance coverage.
